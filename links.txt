git-tfs
A Git/TFS bridge, similar to git-svn http://git-tfs.com/
git-tfs is a two-way bridge between TFS (Team Foundation Server)
and git, similar to git-svn.  It fetches TFS commits into a git
repository, and lets you push your updates back to TFS.
Looks old and deprecated.  TFS should have git by default.
