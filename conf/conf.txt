Microsoft would like to collect anonymous VSTS CLI usage data to improve
our CLI.  Participation is voluntary and when you choose to participate,
your device automatically sends information to Microsoft about how you
use the VSTS CLI.  The data is anonymous and does not include commandline
argument values.  To update your choice, run "vsts configure" again.
Select y to enable data collection. (Y/n): n

You're all set! Here are some commands to try:
 $ vsts login
 $ vsts code pr list
 $ git pr list
