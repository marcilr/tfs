Personal access tokens (PATs) are alternate passwords that
you can use to authenticate in to Azure DevOps.  In this article,
we walk you through how to create or revoke PATS.

Azure DevOps use enterprise-grade authentication to help protect
and secure your data. Clients like Visual Studio and Eclipse
(with the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-in) also support
Microsoft account and Azure AD authentication.
