Create TFS repo programmatically


How to create a remote TFSGIT Repo programatically?
===================================================
Is there any API I could use in order to create a new GIT Repo
in the remote TFS Server?

Ideally something like
  New-GitRepo -server myServer -team team1 -name myRepo

if there isn't a powershell api, i can do with a RESTful HTTP endpoint

The answer is in the docs:
  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/integrate/api/git/repositories#create-a-repository

Use the REST API:

POST https://{instance}/DefaultCollection/_apis/git/repositories/?api-version={version}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": {string},
  "project": {
    "id": {guid}
  }
}

Though I don't know exactly from which TFS version this API
became available.  Given you tagged TFS2015 and the API
compatibility has changed from RTM to update 3.
